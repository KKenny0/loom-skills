description: Route ambiguous or multi-step Loom requests and create Material Lists. Use when the user provides mixed source material and needs help starting, when the request spans research and writing, or when unsure which loom-* skill applies. For clear single-intent requests, the sub-skills (loom-research, loom-maintain) handle intake directly.

# Loom Router + Intake

Route ambiguous requests and create the Material List before any research begins.

## Read First

- `references/schemas.md`

## Cold Start

Before routing, check whether the vault is configured.

If `<vault-root>/.loom/config.yaml` does not exist, run a one-time setup interview:

1. **Vault location** — Where should the vault live? Suggest `~/loom-vault`. Create the directory if needed.
2. **Working language** — `zh`, `en`, or `auto` (detect per query).
3. **Interest areas** — What topics is the user currently working on? (e.g. "AI Agent, Software Architecture"). These become the initial Category directories under `02_Topic_Notes/`.
4. **Default research depth** — `quick` (Source Brief only), `standard` (through Synthesis Pack), or `deep` (full pipeline through Topic Note + Index).

Write `.loom/config.yaml` to the vault root:

```yaml
vault_path: <absolute-path>
language: <zh|en|auto>
categories:
  - <Category>
output_depth: <quick|standard|deep>
created: YYYY-MM-DD
```

If config already exists, read it. Use stored preferences as defaults — user can override per query.

To change settings later, the user can say "reconfigure" or edit `.loom/config.yaml` directly.

## Routing

When the user's intent is clear, route directly:

- **Research materials** (URLs, PDFs, text → synthesis pack): use `loom-research`.
- **Vault maintenance** (validate, migrate, evolve, connect, topic note, index rebuild): use `loom-maintain`.

When intent is ambiguous, ask one question: "Research or maintain?"
- **Research AND write** (e.g. "研究这三个URL并写篇文章"): execute the full pipeline directly — do not route (see Full Pipeline below).

## Intake

### Topic query

When the user provides a topic without sources (e.g. "agent memory 实现原理"):

- If `<vault-root>/.loom/config.yaml` does not exist: guide the user. "Loom works best with source materials. Do you have URLs, PDFs, or text to share? If you just want a quick overview, a chat frontend may be faster."
- If config exists: run source discovery.
  1. Web-search the topic, find 3-5 high-quality sources. Prioritize official docs, technical articles, papers. Avoid social media, marketing content, content farms.
  2. Present the source list to the user for quick approval.
  3. If search results are low-quality, tell the user what was found and ask whether to proceed anyway or provide better sources.
  4. Create Material List. Mark sources with a note that they were web-searched.
  5. Proceed to intake.

### Standard intake

Before routing to `loom-research`, create a Material List:

1. Classify task type: single-source deep dive, multi-source synthesis, theme research, or draft rewrite.
2. For each source, record: ID (S1, S2…), Title, Author, Date, Type, Source Tier, Relevance, Citation Usability, Risk Level, Raw Path, Capture Status.
3. Every source row must include a `raw_path`. If no local capture exists, use the original URL/path or `pasted-local-text` and mark capture status as pending.
4. Record source tier, relevance, citation usability, and risk level conservatively.
5. Suggest next step: `loom-research` or `loom-maintain`.

## Full Pipeline

When the user asks to research AND write, execute all stages in sequence:

1. Intake → Material List (including topic query source discovery if needed)
2. Capture → Raw Captures + inbox Daily Notes
3. Read → Source Brief per source (following loom-research stages)
4. Synthesize → Synthesis Pack (conclusions only; reasoning is internal)
5. Compose → article from Synthesis Pack + Source Briefs (deep-read Compose stage)
6. Topic Note → durable knowledge from Synthesis Pack (loom-maintain)
7. Index → update TOPIC_INDEX and TIMELINE_INDEX (loom-maintain)

At completion, report: article path, Synthesis Pack path, new Topic Notes, vault location.

If the user asks to research only (no write), run stages 1-4.
If the user asks to capture only, read only, or synthesize only, follow P3 stage selection.

## Rules

- Do not deep-read, synthesize, or draft in this stage.
- Do not let Draft or Final wording overwrite Raw Capture, Daily Note, Source Brief, Synthesis Pack, or Topic Note content.
- Detect user query language. All generated artifacts (Source Brief, Synthesis Pack, Draft, Topic Note) use the user's language. Raw Captures always preserve source language.
